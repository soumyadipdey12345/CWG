## Husky Setup

This project is already bootstrapped with husky. However here are the details how you can setup husky in your project:

- Go to [husky getting-started guide](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html) and install & setup husky

- Add the following code in package.json scripts section to check lint & type errors:

```bash
    "check-types": "tsc --noemit",
    "lint": "eslint --fix . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "pre-commit": "npm run lint && npm run check-types"
```

- Now change the pre-commit code in .husky folder to:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npm run pre-commit
```

- - Here pre-commit command would be executed before commit and if there is any error, your commit would be aborted.
